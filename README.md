## What is bt_monitor

bt_monitor receives scan requests for specific bluetooth devices via MQTT, completes the scans and returns the results via MQTT. This project was inspired by [Andrew Freyer's montor script](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/monitor) and makes use of the confidence concept introduced there as well as well as the Raspberry Pi setup instructions and a similar setup for the mqtt topics and home assistant entities. The overall structure and method of deployment of this program was adapted from [GarageQTPi](https://github.com/Jerrkawz/GarageQTPi)

## Hardware

This application is intended to run on a dedicated pi-zero W (or a raspberry pi).

## Installation Instructions for Raspberry Pi Zero W
### Setup of SD Card
1. Download latest version of raspbian buster lite [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

2. Download etcher from [etcher.io](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

3. Image raspbian buster to SD card. Instructions [here] (https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/pi-sd-etcher).

4. Mount boot partition of imaged SD card (unplug it and plug it back in)

5. To enable ssh, create blank file, without any extension, in the root directory called ssh

6. To setup Wi-Fi, create wpa_supplicant.conf file in root directory and add Wi-Fi details for home Wi-Fi:

```
country=US
    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1

network={
    ssid="Your Network Name"
    psk="Your Network Password"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```
7. On the first startup, insert SD card and power on Raspberry Pi Zero W. On first boot, the newly-created wpa_supplicant.conf file and ssh will be moved to appropriate directories. Find the IP address of the Pi via your router.
## Configuration and Setup
1. SSH into the Raspberry Pi (default password: raspberry):
```ssh pi@theipaddress```
2. Change the default password:
``` sudo passwd pi```
3. Download bt_monitor
```git clone https://github.com/bg1000/bt_monitor.git```
4. Change to the monitor directory and run the update and install script
```cd bt_monitor
sudo bash deploy_bt_monitor.sh
```
